# Multi-Spectral-Imaging-RaspberryPi-Design

We present a compact, low-cost and portable multi-spectral imaging setup. The system is built over the open-source hardware and software platform. 

The image sensors used were Red Green Blue (RGB), NoIR (RGB-IR) micro-camera controlled by a Raspberry Pi board mounted with different filters over a multiplexer.

The design files, schematics, and the product images are released with the open hardware license for reuse.

Refer to the provided user manual - **User-Guide-Building-Spectral-Block.pdf** for using the design files.
